    + Fix FTBFS with binutils >= 1.9. Quoting the patch submitter:

      Thanks to Peter De Wachter (Closes: #510500, #518732).

  * Set urgency to “medium”, testing is also affected.

  * debian/rules:
    + Argh, Allegro installs the .so file as the real library, and the .so.x.y

  * debian/rules:
    + Do not call dh_makeshlibs with -V alone because our API/ABI is consistent
      since at least 4.0.2-1, so that packages built with newer versions do not
      have a useless dependency and work with older versions of the allegro

    + Added libarts1-dev to the build dependencies.
    + Removed the automake1.4 build dependency.
  * debian/rules:
    + "binary-indep" depends on "build".
    + We now build the artsdigi plugin.
    + We no longer regenerate the configure file.
    + Made the build rule idempotent by replacing "ln -s" with "ln -sf".
    + Removed the svgalib substvars hack which is now unneeded since the
      svgalib plugin is in a separate package.
  * Removed the lintian override file because we no longer call ldconfig in
    postinst/postrm.
  * Fixed spelling in debian/allegro-config.1 and debian/allegro-examples.1.

    the program.

allegro3937 (1:3937-4) unstable; urgency=low

allegro3937 (1:3937-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * To FTP maintainers: Please allow this packages to go into frozen, this
    release fixes serious bugs in previous allegro series.
  * new upstream WIP release, new branch of Allegro packages:
    various bugfixes, for midi slowdown bug among others
  * set Build-Dependency on gcc-2.95 for i386, gcc-3.0 misscompiles on this
    architecture. Included a query to use the right compiler.
  * no dga, no dga2, no vidmode, no esddigi - trouble with non-PIC code in
    these libraries, waiting for fixes in them (or for my upstream to create a
    workaround in Allegro)
  * creating -dev package for dynamic linking again, useless to separate them
  * removed config.c-patch, fixed in upstream release (see CHANGES)

 -- Eduard Bloch <blade@debian.org>  Sun, 15 Jul 2001 17:05:17 +0200
