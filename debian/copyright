The original readme file contains the following text with regard to the
copyright:

#include <std_disclaimer.h>

    that this code may have on you, your computer, your sanity, your dog, 
    and anything else that you can think of. Use it at your own risk."

   Allegro is gift-ware. It was created by a number of people working in 
   cooperation, and is given to you freely as a gift. You may use, modify, 
   redistribute, and generally hack it about in any way you like, and you do 
   not have to give us anything in return. However, if you like this product 
   you are encouraged to thank us by making a return gift to the Allegro 
   community. This could be by writing an add-on package, providing a useful 
   bug report, making an improvement to the library, or perhaps just 
   releasing the sources of your program so that other people can learn from 
   them. If you redistribute parts of this code or make a game using it, it 
   would be nice if you mentioned Allegro somewhere in the credits, but you 
   are not required to do this. We trust you not to abuse our generosity.
